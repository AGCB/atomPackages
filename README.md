Packages get broken into categories...Community/Core/Dev/Git

The following are all community packages.
Having functionality split into installable/deletable packages can seem 
tedious, but we get communities gathering around best practices. 
Atom gives user download count and time added to startup in milliseconds for each as you are seaching

Here are a few that I've used so far...
## file-icons
This makes file navigation a bit easier. logos are already loaded up. CSS3, JS, HTML5, SVG, yadayada

## highlight-selected
double click on an item, and all other instances of that string of text are blocked out in white.

## minimap
Upper-right zoomed out view of your entire project. You can left click drag through it as well

## minimap-highlight-selected
As you might guess, it's a binding for the highlight-selected to come up on minimap as well

## pigments
shows you colored boxes around any color values. hex, shortname, rgb, etc.

## minimap-pigments
Binding for the minimap

## color-picker
  ControlAltC brings up a color-picker. Press enter to have the code dropped at cursor local

## react-snippets
40+ snippets starting with underscore
